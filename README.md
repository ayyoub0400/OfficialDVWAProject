# Security Focused DevOps CI/CD Pipeline 🚀

## Overview 🛠️

This project implements a security focused CI/CD pipeline with automated security scans, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) validation, and environment-based deployments using AWS services. The pipeline integrates security tools like CodeQL, Snyk, Trivy, Checkov, and ZAP to ensure high code quality and security.

## Architecture 🏗️

### 1️⃣ Continuous Integration (CI)

*   Developers push code to GitHub.
*   Code is analyzed using CodeQL and Snyk for vulnerabilities.
*   Docker images are built and scanned using Trivy.
*   Secure images are pushed to Amazon ECR.

### 2️⃣ Delivery/Deployment (CD)

*   Terraform is used to provision infrastructure.
*   Checkov validates Terraform code security.
*   Deployments are staged in a test environment before production.
*   Security tests are performed using OWASP ZAP.
*   Only validated builds are promoted to production.
*   Amazon CloudWatch monitors deployments.

## Tools & Technologies 🛠️

*   **Version Control:** GitHub 🐙
*   **Security Scanning:** CodeQL, Snyk, Trivy 🔍
*   **Containerization:** Docker 🐳
*   **Artifact Storage:** Amazon ECR 📦
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform 🌍
*   **IaC Security:** Checkov ✅
*   **Deployment Security Testing:** OWASP ZAP 🔥
*   **Monitoring:** Amazon CloudWatch 📊

## Workflow 🔄

1.  Developer commits code → GitHub triggers CI/CD pipeline.
2.  Code & security analysis → CodeQL & Snyk scan source code.
3.  Build & container security scan → Docker image is built & scanned with Trivy.
4.  Push to ECR → Secure image is stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry.
5.  Terraform deployment → Infrastructure is provisioned & validated with Checkov.
6.  Test environment deployment → Code is deployed for testing.
7.  Security testing with ZAP → Ensures the application is secure.
8.  Approval step → Manual approval for production release.
9.  Production deployment → Verified release is deployed.
10. Monitoring & logging → CloudWatch collects logs & metrics.

## Deployment Steps 🚀

### Prerequisites ✅

*   AWS account with necessary IAM permissions.
*   GitHub repository with CI/CD workflows.
*   Terraform installed locally.
*   Docker installed for local testing.

### Steps 📌

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2.  **Configure AWS credentials:**

    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

3.  **Initialize Terraform:**

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

4.  **Apply infrastructure changes:**

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

5.  **Push code to trigger CI/CD pipeline:**

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Deploying update"
    git push origin main
    ```

## Security Best Practices 🔐

*   Always scan for vulnerabilities before deploying.
*   Use IAM roles with the least privilege in AWS.
*   Regularly update dependencies to patch security issues.
*   Monitor logs and alerts in Amazon CloudWatch.

## Future Enhancements 🔮

*   Implement GitHub Actions for automated security patching.
*   Add SonarQube for code quality checks.
*   Enhance observability with AWS X-Ray.
